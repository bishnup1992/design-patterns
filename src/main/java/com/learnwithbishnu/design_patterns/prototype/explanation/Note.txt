Prototype Design Pattern
=========================
1. Prototype design pattern is a creational design pattern.
2.it allows you to create new objects by copying (cloning) existing ones without compromising their internals.
3.his pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new instance is expensive or complex
4.It enables cloning an object without depending on its exact class.

Use Cases
=========
1.Costly Object Creation
2 Complex Objects
3.Frequent Duplicates with Small Variations:
    When you need many copies of a similar object with minor variations,
    such as generating multiple reports with only slight changes in content.
Benefits
========
1. Performance: Cloning is often faster than instantiating a new object.
2. Flexibility: You can add or remove objects at runtime.
3. Simplified object creation: You can create complex objects more easily.
